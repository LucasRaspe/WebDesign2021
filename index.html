          <h1>The Darjeeiling Limited - Review</h1>
          <p>Wes Anderson's 2007 release, The Darjeeling Limited, follows three brothers looking to reconnect years after the death of their father and the abandonment from their mother. Anderson completely denies the rule of thirds once again in the name of symmetry, but where this movie really shines is itâ€™s asymmetry found between the brothers. The youngest brother, Jack, played by Shwartzmen, represents a middle ground in the family while the two older brothers, played by Wilson and Brody, are a reflection of their parents. The movie's resolution comes as the men develop their own identities, as people, rather than imitations of their parents.
